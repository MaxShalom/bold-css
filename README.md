# Bold CSS
A CSS framework for developing websites beautifully and rapidly, containing verbose classes and a bold design.

Hey! I'm working on a CSS framework that looks nice, has understandable classes and details that stand out. I'm designing the look of the framework in [Affinity Design](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) and placing them into the `designs` folder and started development in the `src` folder. In the coming future, documentation will be at [bold.maxshalom.me](https://bold.maxshalom.me). More to come in the near future.
