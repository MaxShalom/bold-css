# Grid
A CSS grid based off of Mozilla's CSS Grid Playground. See the guide [here](https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/css-grid).

After adding a simple, responsive, and minimal grid, I plan to turn this into a CSS framework that includes many components. If you'd like, help out with anything you can and use it in your own projects.
