      Our Mission <br>
      Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; 
      there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought 
      was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either 
      the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would 
      not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low 
      curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about 
      fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her 
      great delight it fitted!
